🌈 TITLE CARD (16:9 – GitHub Repository Header)
Prompt — 16:9 Title Card
Create a professional title card for "Color‑Palette‑Generator" – a tool that generates color palettes from images, themes, or random values.

Visual concept: A vibrant digital workspace focused on color exploration:
- Large gradient fields and swatches arranged in a clean grid
- Color pickers, sliders, hex code blocks, and sample palettes displayed like UI components
- A central wheel or spectrum of colors radiating outward
- Smooth holographic glow behind swatches to emphasize brightness and contrast
- Soft shadowed cards for palette samples (5-color strips)

Color scheme: Dark minimal background (#111114) to let colors pop. Use a range of neon, pastel, and rich spectrum tones across the palettes.

Style: Modern UI design aesthetic blended with artistic color theory. Clean, luminous, visually striking — the feeling of a professional design tool.

Text: “Color‑Palette‑Generator” in bold, modern sans‑serif at bottom center.  
Below it in smaller text: “Generate Beautiful Color Palettes Automatically”.

Aspect ratio: 16:9, suitable for GitHub repository header.


🟪 LOGO MARK (1:1 Square Icon)
Prompt — 1:1 Logo Icon
Create a square icon logo for the "Color‑Palette‑Generator" project.

Visual concept:
- A 5‑color horizontal palette bar (swatch strip) as the central element
- Each rectangle a different vibrant color (rainbow-like but modern)
- Subtle pixel, gradient, or spectrum glow behind the bar
- Clean rounded edges or perfect geometric form
- A tiny droplet or color‑picker eyedropper icon subtly incorporated (but not overwhelming)

Color scheme: Dark background (#111114) with bright spectrum colors:
#FF6B6B, #FFD93D, #6BCB77, #4D96FF, #843bff (or similar vibrants)

Style: Crisp, flat-ish design with subtle depth. Must remain recognizable at small sizes (favicon).  
Square 1:1 aspect ratio, no text.


🟦 HORIZONTAL LOGO (3:1 Wide Banner)
Prompt — 3:1 Wide Banner
Create a horizontal banner logo for the "Color‑Palette‑Generator" tool.

Visual concept:
Left third: A stylized palette strip (from the 1:1 logo) with five vibrant swatches arranged horizontally, glowing lightly.  
Right two‑thirds:
- “Color‑Palette‑Generator” in bold, modern sans‑serif with a subtle gradient fill (from cyan → purple or rainbow wash).
- Below: “Smart Color Schemes from Images & Inspiration” in smaller text.
- Light connecting lines or flowing gradients transitioning from the palette into the text, symbolizing color extraction and transformation.

Color scheme: Dark background (#111114) with vivid spectrum colors for the palette strip and gradient text.

Style: Clean, artistic, creative-tool aesthetic. Professional but colorful.  
Aspect ratio: 3:1 (e.g., 1800×600px).
